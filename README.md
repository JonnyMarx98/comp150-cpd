## Week 1 - 12th September   
This was my fist week at university, the induction week, or as most students call it freshers week. On the Sunday before the week started i went to the 'meet your mentor' event where i met my mentor and did some game concept ideation activities.  Throughout the induction week there were a few induction lectures about the university services, a meeting with my tutor and a programming mixer. During the week I mingled with some course mates which is useful as I will be working in teams with them in the future, I also learnt how to access the learning  space which is where all of the assignment briefs and PowerPoint slides will be. One challenge I encountered was finding the room that I had to go to, however in future our lessons and lectures will be in the same rooms each week so I shouldn't have the problem again. At the end of the week I had a welcome meeting with all the lecturers teaching Computing for Games where we were introduced to the course and what we will be expected to do for the year. From that meeting I learnt that the course we be heavily based on team work, so I will have to learn to work well in a team and try not to shy away from sharing my ideas.   
 
 
## Week 2 – 19th September  
This week started with our fist official principles of computing lecture on Monday.  In this lecture I learnt about the history of computation and video games as well as the different programming languages and paradigms. For the rest of the week consisted of the Lego Robot Challenge which was an introduction to some simple programming in the form of visual programming in addition to being an ice breaker for the class. We were put into teams and worked together to create a robot that could complete a set of space challenges. This taught us about how to work in teams effectively which is useful for future team projects. In my team I was doing the majority of the visual programming which was quite satisfying as it is hard to make any errors so you would have a working program in no time, however it can become quite repetitive when trying to accurately navigate the robot to complete the challenges. I found the first couple of sessions enjoyable but I was eager to start actual programming and lessons after that.   
What I found challenging was trying to figure out the programming of the robot. I overcame this by attempting lots of different things and seeing what they did so I had an idea of what each thing did in the program. From there I was able to complete the space challenges fairly easily.  
 
 
## Week 3 - 26th September  
During this week we were put into groups and were told to design a board game based around a card with a game type on it, for example race to the end. The first challenge we encountered was time management. We were given some time to design the game and create a prototype for it, we spent a long time coming up with ideas but then when we were told we only had 10 minutes left we had to rush to make the prototype. We managed to make the prototype by quickly deciding which ideas to use rather than trying to think about how they would make the game different. In the second half o the lesson we made another board game but had much more time so time management wasn't a problem. Myself and my group were quite proud of the board game, melon colony, we ended up creating, one of us liked it so much they spent some time making it in pygame over the weekend.  
 
 
## Week 4 - 3rd October  
This week started with a lecture about algorithms and annotations which I found quite simple since I had previously learnt about flowcharts and pseudocode at A-Level. We then learnt about agile game development which was quite complex and I didn't understand some of the wording used at the start, such as user story. At the end of the lecture Michael put a definition of user story on the board which made my understanding of what he was talking about before a lot clearer. We were introduced to pygame and briefly shown how to tinker text. I found it quite challenging when I first started trying it for myself, however after some messing around with numbers I ended up with a very large rectangle with the words 'JOHN CENA' in them which I found quite fun.  
 
 
## Week 5 – 10th October  
This week started with another simple lecture about computer logic and memory which I have learnt before. Some of it was new information to me though, so the lectures are still very useful to me. We had our first tinkering graphics workshop this week which I was finding very challenging. I couldn't get my program to work for a while so I asked my course mates how they were doing it and they pointed me in the right direction. I was happy with my program which could change the colours of a rectangle and have a harambe appear on the screen. Other than I had no problems that week.   
 
 
# Week 6 – 17th October   
Despite already learning a bit about algorithm complexities, unlike the other monday lectures this one was quite confusing. I think I understood it all quite well, it just took some time to get my head around it, especially with worksheet C. Attempting to complete worksheet C was definitely the biggest challenge I had this week, myself and a course mates spent ages trying to understand one part of the worksheet. In the second tinkering graphics workshop I managed to complete the first task which was calculating colour distance quite easily, but the other tasks I found very challenging and didn't get any to work. After struggling for a while I had a look at someone else's solution on slack to try and understand how to do it. 
 
# Week 7 – 24th October 
In the Comp 110 lecture on monday we were introduced to object oriented programming and how to make code more efficient by using it. I found the live coding example very useful but I still found it quite challenging to understand everything that was going on. I had another read through the program after the lecture which helped me understand it a bit more. I have been struggling with the tinkering graphics assignment as well, I have decided that I am going to spend more of my free time programming and working on the assignment which should definitely help. Probably the biggest challenge I had this week was attempting to read the 3rd research paper and trying to come up with a research question for my agile essay. To overcome this I need to go over the paper again and do some more research into different aspects of agile development.
